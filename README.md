# Wikipedia Game in Elm

What's the Wikipedia game, you may ask? Pick two random articles, then navigate from one to the other only by following links. This is my attempt at implementing it in Elm ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Still very much a work in progress, I'm learning Elm as I go (•\_•) ( •\_•)>⌐■-■ (⌐■_■)

TODOs:
* Implement a spinner on the welcome page.
* R2D2 to Cat doesn't work - problem with redirects?

Finding path from Timon and Pumbaa to Fairy Wren...
Could not find path, got stuck at: Yale in popular culture
We go from here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University_in_popular_culture
to here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yale_in_popular_culture&redirect=no

...then get stuck, because the only outbound link is:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University_in_popular_culture
