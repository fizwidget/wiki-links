# [WikiPath](https://fizwidget.github.io/wiki-path/index.html)

"WikiPath" is an implementation of the [Wikipedia game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game) in the [Elm programming language](http://elm-lang.org/). It'll try its best to find a path between any two Wikipedia articles, sometimes with amusing results.

An unguided breadth-first search would be very time-consuming, so a heuristic is used to guide the search. This greatly speeds things up, however it means the path found may not necessarily be the shortest possible one.
