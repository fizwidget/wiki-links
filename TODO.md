# TODO

* Backtrack from destination?
* Split up Update module?
* Favour longer string matches, and strings that match links.
* Improve readability of `Pathfinding.Update` by combining `Path` and `Article` somehow?
* Fix heading font size for mobile devices.
* Experiment with improved pathfinding by penalising longer paths.
* Come up with a better heuristic regex (current one doesn't handle quotes, trailing colon, etc).
