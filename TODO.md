# TODO

* Fix heading font size for mobile devices.
* Improve performance of `isUnvisited` check by using a set.
* Improve performance by performing requests in parallel.
* Experiment with improved pathfinding by penalising longer paths.
* Improve readability of `Pathfinding.Update` by combining `Path` and `Article` somehow?
* Come up with a better heuristic regex (current one doesn't handle quotes, trailing colon, etc).
